Showcasing some of my projects

# [(SQL) Chicago Soceoeconomic Data](https://github.com/alexfilo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/ChicagoSocioeconomic%20Data.sql)
* Queried data from 3 files containing information on public schools, crimes, and census data
* Calculated averages and rolling metrics to investiage what poor school districts have in common
* Showcased my ability to use subqueries and joins

# [(Machine Learning in Python) Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/alexfilo/Machine_Learning_Car_Price_Prediction/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Car%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)
* Predicted the price of used cars posted on Ebay
* Used multiple ML techniques: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM
* Optimized hyperparameters using grid search cross validation
* Compared model performances to see which best predicted the car price according to MSE
* Calculated feature importances to see which car features are most important in determining price
* Created a pipeline to perform One Hot Encoding and Scaling
