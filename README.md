Showcasing some of my projects

# [(Python) - Machine Learning - Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/alexfilo/Machine_Learning_Car_Price_Prediction/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Car%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)
* Predicted the price of used cars posted on Ebay
* Used multiple ML techniques: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM
* Optimized hyperparameters using grid search cross validation
* Compared model performances to see which best predicted the car price according to MSE
* Calculated feature importances to see which car features are most important in determining price
* Created a pipeline to perform One Hot Encoding and Scaling

# [(R) Accidents](https://github.com/alexfilo/Accidents/blob/main/accidents.Rmd)
* Investigated what variables contribute to accidents using all data of all US accidents 2017-2020
* Used dplyr to mutate, filter, summarise, select, and arrange data
* Created beautiful, customized graphs using ggplot

# [(SQL) Chicago Soceoeconomic Data](https://github.com/alexfilo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/ChicagoSocioeconomic%20Data.sql)
* Queried data from 3 files containing information on public schools, crimes, and census data
* Calculated averages and rolling metrics to investiage what poor school districts have in common
* Showcased my ability to use subqueries and joins
