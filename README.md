# Here are some of the projects I've completed using different tools!
* Click on the links to see more detailed information for each

# [(Python) - Data Manipulation and Supervised Machine Learning ](https://github.com/alexfilo/Machine_Learning_Car_Price_Prediction/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Car%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)
* Predicted the price of used cars posted on Ebay
* Used multiple ML techniques: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM
* Optimized hyperparameters using grid search cross validation
* Compared model performances to see which best predicted the car price according to MSE
* Calculated feature importances to see which car features are most important in determining price
* Created a pipeline to perform One Hot Encoding and Scaling

# [(SQL) Subqueries & Joins](https://github.com/alexfilo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/ChicagoSocioeconomic%20Data.sql)
* Queried data from 3 files containing information on public schools, crimes, and census data in Chicago
* Worked with data in multiple tables using CTE, Sub-queries, joins
* Used window functions to calculated averages & dense_rank with a partition to investiage what poor school districts have in common

# [(Python) - Machine Learning Classification ](https://github.com/alexfilo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/classification-credit-prediction.ipynb)
* Predicted credit approval result (yes / no) based on 20 features
* Performed Feature Engineering, Log transformation, One Hot Encoding and Standard Scaler
* Used a variety of machine learning techniques (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classification, XGBoost, etc), along with cross validation and hyperparameters tuning

# [(Python) - Computer Vision ](https://github.com/alexfilo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/NBA.ipynb](https://github.com/alexfilo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Computer%20Vision%20Xray.ipynb)
* Identified edges in the image of an X-ray
* Used the 5 steps of the The Canny edge detection algorithm: Noise reduction, Gradient calculation, Non-maximum suppression, Double threshold, Edge Tracking by Hysteresis.

# [(Python) - KMeans Cluster Analysis ](https://github.com/alexfilo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/NBA.ipynb)
* Performed KMeans Cluster Analysis to group all NBA champions 1980-2018
* Utilized Seaborn to visualize differences between the groups
* Massaged the data using groupby, MinMax Scaler, Label Encoder
* Optimized the cluster number with the elbow method

# [(R) - Natural Language Processing ](https://github.com/alexfilo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/NaturalLanguageProcessingYelp.rmd)
* Analyzed 10,000 yelp reviews to predict how many stars the user gives in a review, based on the words used
* Performed Sentiment Analysis using an AFINN lexicon to create many variables
* Fed variables in a linear regression to predict star rating, acheiving a .85 RMSE

# [(R) Graphing & Data Manipulation](https://github.com/alexfilo/Accidents/blob/main/accidents.Rmd)
* Investigated what variables contribute to accidents using data from all US accidents 2017-2020
* Used dplyr to mutate, filter, summarise, select, and arrange data
* Created beautiful, customized graphs using ggplot

# [(Tableau) Dashboard](https://github.com/alexfilo/Alex_Filo_Portfolio/blob/main/images/Tableau%20Covid%20Dashboard.png)
* Visualized data on global Covid metrics as of July 2021
* Dispalyed a map as well as a card, bard chart, and line graph

# [(Power BI) Dashboard](https://github.com/alexfilo/Alex_Filo_Portfolio/blob/main/images/Power%20Bi%20dashboard.png)
* Visualized sales data for a hypothetical company
* Displayed cards, line charts, and bar charts
